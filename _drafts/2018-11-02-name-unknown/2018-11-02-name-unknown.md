## Introduction

The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ) recently crowdsourced data on the number of deaths of homeless people in the U.K. This is an important move. Currently 1 in every 200 people in England are homeless [(source)](https://england.shelter.org.uk/media/press_releases/articles/more_than_300,000_people_in_britain_homeless_today). It has already meant the National Office for Statistics has began to work on their own set of statistics. (It would have, of course, been nice if they had done so out of genuine care, rather than out of guilt and being shown up by local charities and organisers.)

## Lack of context

The press releases around this story did not try to put the statistics in perspective. Undoubtedly the number of people without a home in the U.K. is a national scandal. However, without putting the results around deaths in the context of how many homeless people there are, the press missed a story.

In a given year, the average male will die with a probability of 1/136 and the average female 1/193. To get this stat, you need the number of people dying in a given year *and* the number of people overall.

The press releases around this story failed to mention the number of homeless people in the U.K. It is frighteningly high. In London alone there ... people sleeping on the streets on any given night. Overall, Shelter estimates that there are currently over 250,000 people in the U.K. who are homeless in the U.K. That includes sleeping rough, in temporary accommodation and at a hostel. (Check this).

This is important, because amongst the deaths there are 94 year olds dying of cancer. Without the comparison, there is no understanding of how much homelessness effects one's life expectancy.

Living without a home causes multiple medical issues: dehydration, stress, hypothermia, even [starvation](source). Given this, one would expect there to be a much higher death rate amongst homeless people than the general population. Doing a back of the envelope calculation, given the BIJ's homeless death statistic and Shelter's estimate of the number of homeless people, homeless people die at 1/4 the rate of the average person.

## Analysis of how many deaths have been missed

If we start with the safe assumption that homeless people die at a rate *at least* as high as that of the average person, this means that at least 3/4 of homeless deaths are not being reported as such. Given the possibility of homelessness vastly increasing the chance of dying, this figure will almost certainly be far higher. "Homeless people are twice as likely to die from infections, and nine times more likely to commit suicide." (Jon Sparkes, chief executive of Crisis.)

Look at death rate among those on the streets. In London compared to elsewhere.

Use London estimates to provide a countrywide estimate. 'Until we are reporting figures close to this amount, we can confident that there are homeless deaths we are not reporting'. Even though London has a centralised system, the BIJ still found deaths among homeless people not reported there.

Once these figures are reported in more detail, we can use the data to make meaningful contributions, looking at ways to optimise hospitalisation for homeless people, links between the amount spent on - and cuts to - certain social services and numbers of homeless deaths. Currently we're staring in the dark at a tragedy. This brings the outline of one aspect to it. Other work has pick out other dark bits. With more stats on this, we'd still be in a tragedy but we'd at least be able to see it. And seeing enables acting.

In a study of 615 homeless people in Poland, 176 died in the analysed period of six years. So each year, on average 30 of the participants died. That is almost 5%. died. This is far higher than amongst the average person. (I think these were people all living on the streets? Were they homeless for the whole time?)

Something about needing more data on demographics, age, social background, addiction etc. because these affect life expectancy

## Name: 'unknown'

Going through the statistics, you realise how little is known about even the people whose deaths have been reported. Some are reported died to have died between April and September - a 5 month window. 1/2 are reported as name 'unknown'.

## Moving Forwards

I think TBIJ's data should be seen as a database of tragedies, with people as young as ... dying on the streets. However, to consider the figure of 441 people dying homeless shocking is, unfortunately, to ignore that the true figure is much much higher.

The individual deaths were a tragedy. One can read through the database to hear the stories of sisters struggling with drug addiction, mothers battling mental health issues, war, heartbreak, injury. The BIJ managed to collate these tragedies, the ones that press, charities and local governments did not entirely forget.

However, the main effect of compiling all the stories they could in one place revealed another tragedy: how many homeless people are forgotten. They die in hospitals, streets and temporary accomodation, struggling through. We must await the statistics from the ONS to see how many more we can remember.

## Questions

How much more likely are homeless people to die from murder? (I know suicide) This is probably obtainable from police reports

abuse, and fatal illnesses. They are 17 times more likely to be a victim
of violence, twice as likely to die from infections, and nine times 
more likely to commit suicide.”
