<!-- Part 1 -->

My Masters dissertation was titled 'an epidemiological approach to modelling political revolution and repression'. You can read the paper, learn about the models I built and recreate the simulations [here](https://github.com/joekroese/math-of-revolution). I gave a public talk on the lecture that's available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iKBkP5NKAA). In this post I want to give a written summary of that talk.

Q: What makes us human?

Unique Correct Answer: Agency and our relations

## Agent-Based Models

Talking about fish
so we can talk about birds

### Birds: Murmuration of Starlings

### Humans: Economic Inequality

## Social Networks

### Reasons to not be friends with a mathematician (a non-exhaustive list)

- They make visualisations like this:
- And spreadsheets like this

### Features

#### Heavy tails

#### Small world

#### Triadic Closure

Every triangle is a love triangle when you love triangles

### Models
