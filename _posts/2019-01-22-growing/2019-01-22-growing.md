In my latest "Jo why don't you put your energy towards things more conducive to your career?" move, I have started writing algorithms mimicing biological growth to grow jewellery and furniture.

I'm using Houdini and teaching myself from the [Entagma](http://www.entagma.com/) website (these guys are the best). My friend Peter is providing the furniture models.

These pics are based are of a chair I made. The growth algorithm is based off a [reaction-diffusion algorithm](http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf) created by Alan Turing to describe the formation of patterns on animals. This area is called Morphogenesis - super interesting.
