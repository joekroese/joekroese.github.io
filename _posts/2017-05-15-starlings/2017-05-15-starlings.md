## Theory
The model is based overwhelmingly on the paper 'Self-organized aerial displays of thousands of starlings: a model' by H. Hildenbrandt C. Carere and C.K. Hemelrijka. It's available for free [here](https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/21/6/1349/333856). (Wow, isn't Open Access academia lovely?)

## History
I made this as my project for MATH 437 Mathematical Methods in Biology at McGill University in the 2017 Winter Term with Aashna Uppal.

# What's here
The project was written in [Processing 3](https://processing.org/), which looks a lot like Java. It's also the language I first learnt to code in (thank you you great people!) I've included two folders.
