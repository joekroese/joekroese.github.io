The Gratitude Machine is an AI who is learning how to be thankful. People can scribble, text and speak short thank-yous to the TGM who absorbs them and then multiplies them.

Trained to speak English on a monumental corpus of online text, the TGM is a neural network that can 

The work is inspired by a treatment for depression where the sufferer of depression must repeat the words 'thank you thank you thank you' repeatedly. In doing so, the sufferer trains their brain to be thankful for the world around them, moving towards a place of healing. (Research: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2016.12.013 and http://dx.doi.org/10.17239/jowr-2009.01.03.1) At a meeting of my identity as both a programmer and a sufferer of depression, I trained TGM the same way I train my brain.

The Gratitude Machine can be communicated with through various interfaces. For installations, they prefer to have their gratitudes projected on a wall in black text. Visitors can text the GM with their gratitudes, appearing on the wall in red text. These red texts fade from red to black as they are absorbed by the GM. The visitor's gratitudes then train the GM, teaching what thankfulness looks like so that it can be more thankful. The GM is able to receive gratitude and multiply it.

The work is inspired from discussions I had with Milton Almonacid, a Chilean social theorist and representative of the indigenous group *la Comunidad de Historia Mapuche*. We collaborated at 'The Cartographies of the Vanishing Now', a week-long conference and workshop exploring and creating art in the anthropecene. We believe TGM offers a powerful interface for changing the world through gratitude.

Many visitors have asked me for collections of TGM's gratitudes, to help them in their daily life, finding things to be grateful for outside of an installation setting. To meet this suggestion, I am now developing a webapp, allowing constant access to TGM.
